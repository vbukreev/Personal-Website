# Personal-Website
The website is a dynamic portfolio that showcases my expertise in game development. It is designed carefully to emphasize three of my most significant projects, giving visitors a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and achievements in the field. The user interface is crafted with user engagement in mind, featuring intuitive endpoints that guide visitors through my game development journey. Each project is presented with detailed descriptions and insights, allowing users to delve into the creative and technical processes behind your work. In addition, the website offers direct links for downloading and trying out the games I've created, facilitating an interactive experience that connects my audience with some of my creations. This approach not only showcases my proficiency in developing engaging game interfaces but also demonstrates my commitment to sharing my passion for software with a wider audience.

Please note that this project is still under development and currently only shows some basic applied functionalities of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
